var: 
a. Variables declared with var have FUNCTION or GLOBAL scope --> they are accessible throughout the entire function or globally 
if declared outside any function.
b. Var variables are HOISTED --> they are moved to top of their scope during compilation 
c. Var allows variable redeclaration and is not block scoped , and that changed value is seen throughout the function 

function example() {
  var x = 10;
  if (true) {
    var x = 20;
    console.log(x); // Outputs 20
  }
  console.log(x); // Outputs 20
}

let: 
a. It is block scoped variables  - variables are limited within the block in which it is declared 
b. LET variables are NOT hoisted --> they are not moved to top of their scope 
c. it prevents redeclaration within the same scope

function example() {
  let x = 10;
  if (true) {
    let x = 20;
    console.log(x); // Outputs 20
  }
  console.log(x); // Outputs 10
}

const: 
const is also used to declare variables that are BLOCK_SCOPED and whose value remains constant (immutable) throughout the execution
const PI = 3.14
console.log(PI); // Outputs 3.14

// Trying to reassign the value of a constant variable will result in an error
PI = 10

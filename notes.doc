what is JavaScript Transpiler?

A JavaScript transpiler is a tool that converts source code written in one version of JavaScript (usually a more recent or cutting-edge version) into another version 
of JavaScript that is compatible with a broader range of browsers or environments. The primary purpose of a JavaScript transpiler is to ensure that code written using the latest language features can be executed in older browsers or runtime environments that may not support those features.

ex: babel , coffeescript, typescript includes a transpiler while compiling the code,  Dart 

Babel is an open-source JavaScript compiler that allows developers to write code in the latest ECMAScript (ES) syntax (also known as ES6 or ES2015 and beyond) and then transform or 
"transpile" that code into an older version of JavaScript (usually ES5) that can run in older browsers and environments that do not support the latest JavaScript features. Babel is 
often used in modern web development to ensure that web applications are compatible with a wide range of browsers.

What is package managers?
Package managers in JavaScript are tools that simplify the process of managing and distributing libraries, frameworks, and other code dependencies in a JavaScript project.
 They help developers install, update, and organize the various software packages that their projects rely on. Package managers are essential in modern web development because they make it easier 
 to handle complex dependencies and ensure that all project collaborators are using the same versions of libraries.

 ex> npm and yarn
